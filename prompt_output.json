"In the video, Dr. Liv for Change Justin Lee, a physical therapist, provides a basic understanding of kinesiology classes. Kinesiology is defined as the study of human movement and involves analyzing the various components involved in movement, such as muscles, joints, nerves, coordination, and motor skills. The example of a baseball player moving from point A to point B is used to illustrate how kinesiology examines the processes underlying movement, including the nervous system's role in signaling muscles to contract and create movement. Kinesiology classes cover topics like the nervous system, muscle contraction, joint movement, and factors that can affect movement, such as muscle tightness or joint stiffness. Overall, kinesiology classes delve into the mechanics and intricacies of human movement to help students understand how the body functions during various physical activities."
